# Week 2: Units and Dimensional Analysis

## SCIE1500 - Analytical Methods for Scientists
### Semester 1, 2026

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
1. Convert between SI and other unit systems
2. Use dimensional analysis to check calculations
3. Work with scientific notation
4. Apply significant figures correctly

---

## 1. The SI System

The **Système International (SI)** provides standardized units:

| Quantity | SI Unit | Symbol |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Length | metre | m |
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Time | second | s |
| Temperature | kelvin | K |
| Amount | mole | mol |
| Electric current | ampere | A |
| Luminous intensity | candela | cd |

---

## 2. SI Prefixes

| Prefix | Symbol | Factor |
|--------|--------|--------|
| giga | G | 10⁹ |
| mega | M | 10⁶ |
| kilo | k | 10³ |
| centi | c | 10⁻² |
| milli | m | 10⁻³ |
| micro | μ | 10⁻⁶ |
| nano | n | 10⁻⁹ |

### Example Conversions
- 5.2 km = 5200 m = 5.2 × 10³ m
- 350 μL = 0.000350 L = 3.5 × 10⁻⁴ L

---

## 3. Dimensional Analysis

**The Golden Rule**: Units must be consistent on both sides of an equation.

### Example: Checking a Formula

Is the equation $v = \sqrt{2gh}$ dimensionally correct?

Left side: $[v] = \text{m/s}$

Right side: $\sqrt{[g][h]} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2} \cdot \text{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}} = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$

✅ Both sides have the same dimensions!

## 4. Scientific Notation

Scientific notation expresses numbers as: $a \times 10^n$

Where:
- $1 \leq a < 10$
- $n$ is an integer

### Examples
- Speed of light: 299,792,458 m/s = 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s
- Bacterial cell size: 0.000002 m = 2 × 10⁻⁶ m

---

## 5. Significant Figures

### Rules
1. Non-zero digits are always significant
2. Zeros between non-zero digits are significant
3. Leading zeros are NOT significant
4. Trailing zeros after decimal ARE significant

### In Calculations
- **Multiplication/Division**: Keep fewest sig figs
- **Addition/Subtraction**: Keep fewest decimal places

---

## Discipline Examples

### Agricultural Science
Converting irrigation rates: 2.5 acre-feet/year to m³/day

### Biology
Cell concentrations: 3.2 × 10⁶ cells/mL

### Environmental Science
Atmospheric CO₂: 420 ppm = 420 × 10⁻⁶ = 4.2 × 10⁻⁴

---

## Key Terms

- **SI units**: International standard units
- **Dimensional analysis**: Checking unit consistency
- **Scientific notation**: Expressing very large/small numbers
- **Significant figures**: Meaningful digits in a measurement

---

## Practice Problems

1. Convert 45 km/h to m/s
2. Check if $E = mc^2$ is dimensionally consistent
3. Express 0.0000034 g in scientific notation
4. Calculate: (3.45 × 10²) × (2.1 × 10⁻³)
