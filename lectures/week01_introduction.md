# Week 1: Introduction to Quantitative Methods

## SCIE1500 - Analytical Methods for Scientists
### Semester 1, 2026

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
1. Understand the role of mathematics in scientific research
2. Identify different types of data and variables
3. Use basic Python for scientific calculations
4. Design simple experiments with appropriate controls

---

## 1. Why Mathematics in Science?

Science is fundamentally about understanding patterns in nature. Mathematics provides:
- **A universal language** for describing these patterns
- **Precision** in our predictions
- **Quantitative testing** of hypotheses

### Real-World Examples by Discipline

| Discipline | Mathematical Application |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Agricultural Science | Crop yield prediction models |
| Biology | Population growth equations |
| Biomedical Sciences | Drug dosage calculations |
| Environmental Science | Climate change projections |
| Geology | Radioactive decay dating |

## 2. Types of Data

### Quantitative Data (Numbers)
- **Continuous**: Can take any value (temperature, mass, concentration)
- **Discrete**: Only certain values (number of cells, population count)

### Qualitative Data (Categories)
- **Nominal**: No order (species, colour, treatment type)
- **Ordinal**: Has order (pain scale 1-10, education level)

---

## 3. Variables in Experiments

### Independent Variable
- What you **change** or **manipulate**
- Example: Amount of fertilizer applied

### Dependent Variable
- What you **measure** as a result
- Example: Plant height after 4 weeks

### Controlled Variables
- What you keep **constant**
- Example: Water amount, light exposure, soil type

## 4. Introduction to Python

Python is the tool we'll use for data analysis throughout this course.

```python
# Basic calculations
mass = 5.0  # kg
velocity = 10.0  # m/s
kinetic_energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity**2
print(f"Kinetic energy: {kinetic_energy} Joules")
```

### Why Python?
- Free and open source
- Widely used in scientific research
- Extensive libraries for data analysis
- Easy to learn and read

---

## Key Terms

- **Variable**: A quantity that can change
- **Hypothesis**: A testable prediction
- **Control group**: Group receiving no treatment
- **Experimental group**: Group receiving treatment
- **Sample size**: Number of observations (n)

## Pre-Lab Preparation

Before the lab session:
1. Open the Week 1 notebook in Google Colab
2. Run through the Python basics cells
3. Try the practice problems at the end
