## Section A: Variables and Data Types (5 marks each)

### Question 1
Classify each of the following as quantitative (continuous or discrete) or qualitative (nominal or ordinal):

a) Number of bacterial colonies on a plate
b) Soil pH measured with a meter
c) Blood type (A, B, AB, O)
d) Pain level on a scale of 1-10
e) Mass of a rock sample in grams

---

### Question 2
For the following experiment, identify the independent, dependent, and two controlled variables:

> A biologist wants to test how different light intensities affect the rate of photosynthesis in spinach leaves. She places leaf discs in solutions under lamps of varying brightness and measures the time for the discs to float.

## Section B: Python Basics (10 marks each)

### Question 3
Using Python, calculate the following. Show your code and output.

a) The volume of a sphere with radius 5.3 cm (V = 4/3 × π × r³)

b) The concentration of a solution after dilution:
   - Initial concentration: 2.5 M
   - Initial volume: 25 mL
   - Final volume: 500 mL
   - Use C₁V₁ = C₂V₂

### Question 4
A student measured the heights of 10 sunflower plants (in cm):
`45.2, 52.1, 48.7, 50.3, 47.9, 51.8, 49.2, 46.5, 53.0, 48.1`

Write Python code to:
a) Store these values in a list
b) Calculate the mean height
c) Find the range (max - min)
d) Count how many plants are taller than 50 cm

---

## Section C: Application Problems (15 marks each)

### Question 5
A population of rabbits grows according to the formula:
N(t) = N₀ × e^(rt)

Where:
- N₀ = initial population = 100 rabbits
- r = growth rate = 0.15 per month
- t = time in months

a) What is the population after 6 months?
b) How long will it take for the population to double?
c) Write Python code to verify your answers.

---

### Question 6
Design a simple experiment to test the following hypothesis:

> "Plants watered with rainwater grow taller than plants watered with tap water."

Your answer should include:
- Independent variable
- Dependent variable
- At least 3 controlled variables
- Sample size and replication
- How you would measure and record data

## Answer Key (for self-checking)

1a) Discrete quantitative
1b) Continuous quantitative  
1c) Nominal qualitative
1d) Ordinal qualitative
1e) Continuous quantitative

3a) V ≈ 623.6 cm³
3b) C₂ = 0.125 M

4b) Mean = 49.28 cm
4c) Range = 6.8 cm
4d) 3 plants

5a) N(6) ≈ 246 rabbits
5b) t ≈ 4.62 months
