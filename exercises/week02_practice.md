### Question 3
Check whether the following equations are dimensionally correct:

a) v = at where v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time

b) E = mgh where E is energy, m is mass, g is acceleration, h is height

### Question 4
The drag force on a sphere moving through fluid is given by:
F = 6πηrv

Where:
- F is force (N)
- η is dynamic viscosity (?)
- r is radius (m)
- v is velocity (m/s)

Determine the SI units of dynamic viscosity (η) using dimensional analysis.
